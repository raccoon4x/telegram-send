# Telegram Send

This is my first project using GoLang. This project provides a simple command-line tool to send messages, files, and images to a Telegram chat. It is built in Go and utilizes the Telegram Bot API for communication.

## Features

- Send text messages to a specified Telegram chat.
- Send files and images with optional captions.
- Read messages from stdin to send to a Telegram chat.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this tool, you need to:

1. Create a Telegram bot by talking to [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and get the bot token.
2. Find out the chat ID where you want to send messages.
